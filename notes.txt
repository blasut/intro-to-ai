Trying out some AI coourselol

Agent <- sensors <- environment

Agent -> actuators -> environment

Perception Action Cycle

Termer:

Fully vs partially observable

Fully: All cards on the table, the information is sufficent to make a choice
Partially: Poker, its needed to store past moves and guess to make a choice.

Deterministic vs stochastic

Deterministic = chesse
Stochastic = games with dice, because we cant know the outcome, certain amount of randomness

discrete = final amount of possible actions
continous = inifinte amount of possible actions

benign vs adversarial

benign = has no own purpose
adversarial = might have purpose

AI is uncertainty manager
